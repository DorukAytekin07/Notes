\lecture{4}{2025 February 12 11:24}{Imperfect Tense}
We use imperfect tense in latin for explain an event made in the past but it took some
time not happened immediately it continued for a time this is equal to past continious tense
in the english \\\\
and for the verb conjugation we use present stem for this and add -ba appendix which means was and finally add personal
endings like -o -tis -t for example 
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{llll}
    &present stem & infix & personal endings& \\
    &ama& ba & t& \\
    &loving &was &he/she/it&
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}[I]
  \item Identify the present stem  
  \item Add the infix -ba- 
  \item Add the personal endings 
\end{enumerate} \\\\
