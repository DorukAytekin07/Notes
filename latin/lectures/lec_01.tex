In latin we have declensions for now we only have to know 3 of them 
1st declension is ended with a in the nominative case 
and the 2nd declension is finishing with us in the nominative form but 
in the 3rd declension there is no unique pattern for finishing
\\ \\
the finishing are change case by case and you have to memorize them i will
write them to anki so you cal memorize and retain them more goodly but now
I don't know any about of them after learn the all cases also there 6 cases in the 
latin we will memorize every declension and a remainder there is a lot of thing to 
memorize in the latin from words to declension to stems to tenses rules so you have to 
prepare for this
