In latin we have same subjects like in the other languages
like I means ego you means tu and 3rd person we have also plural of them 
but we don't consider now later we will learn also we have subject verb
agreement like in the turkish I explain right now when you know who make the action
like ego you add o to end of your verb like this
\begin{center}
ego \space saluto \\
tu \space salutas \\
amicus \space salutat\\
\end{center}
in turkish we have this like when you I make you can say yaparim instead of ben yaparim
it is too weird to add ben \\
and don't forget it this endings can be change by grammar so when you using them you
have to also aware of what grammer we are using right now
