Today we started to implements vectors and we coded their 
memory allocation depending on the size you give and push item 
and look at the also see the capacity and size also determine
the is the vector empty tomorrow will be more diffucult because
we will implement insert and delete operations also even we 
have an idea dynamic reallocating if the capacity is filled 
but to be honest today was good
