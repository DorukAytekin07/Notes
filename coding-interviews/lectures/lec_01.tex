\lecture{1}{2025 February 10 18:14}{Arrays}
In this topic we don't have much to write but we have many thing to implement
via C++ or Python probably I will implement with C++ because it is more low level
and what you will implement gaved from the coding interview university implement what
he's saying all you have to know array is data structure and it stores values linearly 
and you can acces them with using indexes and remainder indexes start from 0 not 1 be careful
all the other stuff can understand better by implementing it as I said before
\\\\
Also we learned iteration with while and for loop from the berkeley and the above paragraph
write by CS50 which is the most worst thing in the CS world so i can 
be a little offisve at there actually do you know if we write the berkeley videos'
it would be great because they are preety useful and educative besides CS50 
so we will take notes from the next berkeley videos'
