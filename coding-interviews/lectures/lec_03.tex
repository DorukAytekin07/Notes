why we add 2 to it's end we didn't ad this to other anyways we add it also it's end \\\\
Today we implement remains methods which are insert delete remove find pop prepend they were
pretty easy I could implement with no struggle but tomorrow task is a little sounds harder
in my opinion which is array capacity double but I think we can make it anyways today was also
good for the coding I am enjoying from them
